## Research Interests

- Polarization Codes and Channel Polarization Theory
- Error correction encoding and decoding
- Applied Machine Learning

My current research direction is error correction coding. During my graduate studies, I studied polarization codes and channel polarization theory, and conducted in-depth research on the construction theory and drilling theory of polarization codes. I proposed a low complexity construction method based on Monte Carlo simulation. I also studied polarization adjusted convolutional codes, also known as PAC codes, and analyzed the polarization channel capacity of PAC codes. I also proposed a drilling strategy suitable for PAC codes to make their code rate flexible and code length variable.
